<h3>Machine Learning Examples</h3>

<h4>This repository conatins implemetation of various ML algorithms. It is divided into 3 subcategories as follows:</h4>

<ul><li><b>ML Algorithm Implementation Using Java: </b>Implematation of algorithms using plain Java(No libaray have been used).</li>
<li><b>ML Algorithm Implementation Using Python: </b>Implementation of algorithms using Python again no ML libaray have been used like scikit-learn for example.</li>
<li><b>ML Algorithm Implementation Using Tensorflow: </b>Implementation of algorithms using Tensorflow.</li>
<li><b>Data Visualization: </b>Visualization of various dataset to find out correlation matrix and outliers etc.</li>
<li><b>Tensorflow Building Blocks(Examples): </b>Covering through examples various basics building blocks of Tensorflow.</li> 
</ul>
